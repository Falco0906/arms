# Search Bar Testing Guide

## Issue Fixed: Search Bar Focus Loss

### Problem
When typing in search bars, the input would lose focus after each character, requiring users to click back into the search box for each character.

### Root Cause
The search handler functions were defined inside component definitions, causing them to be recreated on every render. This made React think the input was receiving a "new" onChange handler, causing focus loss.

### Solution Applied

1. **Moved handlers outside component definitions**
2. **Used `useCallback` to memoize handlers**
3. **Added debounced search for API calls**
4. **Fixed all search inputs across the application**

### Search Bars Fixed

1. **Header Search** (`/api/users/search`)
   - Search for users by name or email
   - Debounced to prevent excessive API calls
   - Shows dropdown with results

2. **Course Search** (Dashboard)
   - Search courses by title, code, or description
   - Filters courses in real-time
   - Used in both main dashboard and filter modal

3. **Material Search** (Course Detail)
   - Search materials by title or type
   - Filters materials in real-time
   - Combined with material type filter

### Testing Instructions

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Test Header Search**:
   - Click in the header search box
   - Type multiple characters without clicking
   - Verify focus is maintained
   - Check that search results appear

3. **Test Course Search**:
   - Go to Dashboard page
   - Click in the course search box
   - Type multiple characters without clicking
   - Verify focus is maintained
   - Check that courses filter in real-time

4. **Test Material Search**:
   - Go to a course detail page
   - Click in the material search box
   - Type multiple characters without clicking
   - Verify focus is maintained
   - Check that materials filter in real-time

5. **Test Filter Modal Search**:
   - Open the course filter modal
   - Click in the search box
   - Type multiple characters without clicking
   - Verify focus is maintained

### Expected Behavior

- ✅ **Focus maintained**: Input should stay focused while typing
- ✅ **Real-time filtering**: Results should update as you type
- ✅ **No re-renders**: Input should not lose focus between characters
- ✅ **Debounced API calls**: User search should not make excessive requests
- ✅ **Smooth experience**: No clicking required between characters

### Technical Details

#### Before (Problematic)
```javascript
const Dashboard = () => {
  const handleCourseSearch = (query) => {
    // Handler recreated on every render
    setCourseSearchQuery(query);
    // ... filtering logic
  };
  
  return (
    <input onChange={(e) => handleCourseSearch(e.target.value)} />
  );
};
```

#### After (Fixed)
```javascript
const handleCourseSearch = useCallback((query) => {
  // Handler memoized, stable reference
  setCourseSearchQuery(query);
  // ... filtering logic
}, [courses]);

const Dashboard = () => {
  return (
    <input onChange={(e) => handleCourseSearch(e.target.value)} />
  );
};
```

### Performance Improvements

1. **Reduced re-renders**: Memoized handlers prevent unnecessary re-renders
2. **Debounced API calls**: User search waits 300ms before making API request
3. **Stable references**: useCallback ensures handlers don't change between renders
4. **Better UX**: Smooth typing experience without focus loss

### Browser Compatibility

- ✅ Chrome/Chromium
- ✅ Firefox
- ✅ Safari
- ✅ Edge

### Troubleshooting

If search bars still lose focus:

1. **Check browser console** for React warnings
2. **Verify handlers are memoized** with useCallback
3. **Check for component re-renders** in React DevTools
4. **Ensure no inline functions** in onChange handlers
